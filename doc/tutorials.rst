Tutorials
=========

We show in these tutorials how to use the FFT classes. These classes are the basic
components of FluidFFT.  Note however that for most users, it's going to be
simpler to use directly the "operators" classes
:class:`fluidfft.fft2d.operators.OperatorsPseudoSpectral2D` and
:class:`fluidfft.fft3d.operators.OperatorsPseudoSpectral3D`.
