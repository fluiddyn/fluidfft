Supported FFT libraries and their installation
==============================================

fftw3 (better to build with OpenMP enabled)
-------------------------------------------

`FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/>`_ (*Fastest Fourier Transform in the West*) is the
standard open-source library for discrete Fourier transform.

.. todo::

   Try hybrid OpenMP + MPI...

fftw3_mpi
---------

`FFTW <http://www.fftw.org/>`_ provide their parallel MPI implementation.

If a system-wide installation of FFTW with OpenMP and MPI is not available,
the user can make a local installation in a user-accessible directory. You can
utilize this bash script with some modifications to the first few lines to
install the FFTW library.

.. literalinclude:: install_fftw.sh
   :language: shell


MKL library (FFT by intel)
--------------------------

There are wrappers to use the MKL library (FFT by intel) using the FFTW
API. See the file ``site.cfg.mkl``.

`pfft <https://github.com/mpip/pfft>`_
--------------------------------------

*"PFFT is a software library for computing massively parallel, fast Fourier
transformations on distributed memory architectures. PFFT can be understood as
a generalization of FFTW-MPI to multidimensional data decomposition. The
library is written in C and MPI."*

You may adapt the shell script given below to install pfft. Some other scripts
related to IBM clusters can be found `here <https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/workgroup/pippig/software.php.en#scripts>`_.

.. literalinclude:: install_pfft.sh
   :language: shell

This script can be downloaded with::

  wget https://foss.heptapod.net/fluiddyn/fluidfft/-/raw/branch/default/doc/install/install_pfft.sh

`p3dfft <https://www.p3dfft.net/>`_
-----------------------------------

*"Parallel Three-Dimensional Fast Fourier Transforms, dubbed P3DFFT, is a
library for large-scale computer simulations on parallel platforms. [...]
P3DFFT uses 2D, or pencil, decomposition. This overcomes an important
limitation to scalability inherent in FFT libraries implementing 1D (or slab)
decomposition: the number of processors/tasks used to run this problem in
parallel can be as large as N2, where N is the linear problem size."*

To use p3dfft with python binding, we need a shared library (.so) and therefore,
we use a modified version of the package. Please follow the process detailed
in the INSTALL file of this fork of the official p3dfft github repository :
`CyrilleBonamy/p3dfft <https://github.com/CyrilleBonamy/p3dfft>`_. The process
can be summarized as follows :

It can be convenient to link p3dfft with fftw3. A single fftw directory with
lib and include directories must exist for this purpose.

For example, on Debian system, you can do that with::

  ROOTFFTW=$HOME/opt/fft_gcc
  mkdir -p $ROOTFFTW/include
  mkdir -p $ROOTFFTW/lib
  cp /usr/include/fftw* $ROOTFFTW/include
  cp /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfftw3* $ROOTFFTW/lib

And next you can compile p3dfft with the following command::

  CC=mpicc CCLD=mpif90 ./configure --enable-fftw --with-fftw=$ROOTFFTW \
      --prefix=/opt/p3dfft/2.7.5

You may adapt the shell script given below to automate this process :

.. literalinclude:: install_p3dfft.sh
   :language: shell

This script can be downloaded with::

  wget https://foss.heptapod.net/fluiddyn/fluidfft/-/raw/branch/default/doc/install/install_p3dfft.sh

See also how we build p3dfft with intel compiler for the :doc:`occigen`.

Modify fftw.h ! https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3/issues/18

   How can I install Cuda? Link? Advice?

Unsupported libraries
=====================

`openfft <http://www.openmx-square.org/openfft/>`__
---------------------------------------------------

There is no class of fluidfft to use the library openfft because it does not
provide a function for inverse fft.


`2decomp <http://www.2decomp.org>`__
------------------------------------

There is no class of fluidfft to use the library 2decomp because we didn't
manage to build their shared libraries.
