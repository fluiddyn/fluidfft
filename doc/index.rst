FluidFFT documentation
======================

This package provides C++ classes and their Python wrapper classes useful to
perform Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with different libraries, in particular

- `fftw3 <http://www.fftw.org/>`_ and `fftw3-mpi
  <http://www.fftw.org/fftw3_doc/Distributed_002dmemory-FFTW-with-MPI.html>`_

- `pfft <https://github.com/mpip/pfft>`_

- `p3dfft <https://github.com/sdsc/p3dfft>`_

- `mpi4py-fft <https://bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py-fft>`_

- `cufft <https://developer.nvidia.com/cufft>`_ (fft library by CUDA
  running on GPU)

`pfft <https://github.com/mpip/pfft>`_, `p3dfft
<https://github.com/sdsc/p3dfft>`_ and `mpi4py-fft
<https://bitbucket.org/mpi4py/mpi4py-fft>`_ are specialized in computing FFT
efficiently on several cores of big clusters. The data can be split in pencils
and can be distributed on several processes.

FluidFFT provides an unified API to use all these libraries. FluidFFT is not
limited to just performing Fourier transforms. It is a complete development
framework for codes using (distributed) FFT. A simple API allows the developers
to easily perform operations on data in real and spectral spaces (gradient,
divergence, rotational, sum over wavenumbers, computation of spectra, etc.) and
deal with the data distribution (gather the data on one process and scatter the
data to many processes) without having to consider the internal organization of
every FFT library.

FluidFFT has been created to be:

- Easy to install (see :ref:`install`).

- Easy to use, both for simple users and for developers (see
  :ref:`tuto`). FluidFFT hides the internal complication of (distributed) FFT
  libraries.

- Robust (unittest coverage larger than 90 %).

- Highly efficient.

  The architecture of the code and the tools used (C++ classes, Cython wrapper
  and `Pythran <https://github.com/serge-sans-paille/pythran>`_ / `Transonic
  <https://transonic.readthedocs.io>`_ computational functions) leads to very
  good performances.

  Moreover, Python developers can easily measure the performance cost of using
  Python compared to coding in pure C++. This cost has to be compared to the
  cost of the FFT in pure C++, which of course strongly varies with the size of
  the arrays. From our experience with real cases, the "Python cost" goes from
  very small (for small cases) to completely negligible (for medium and large
  cases).

  A great advantage of FluidFFT is that it allows the user to find (see
  :ref:`bench`) and to choose the most efficient solution for a particular
  case.  Since the fastest library depends on the case and on the hardware, it
  is really a useful feature for performance!

FluidFFT is therefore a very useful tool to write HPC applications using FFT,
as for example pseudo-spectral simulation codes. For an example of how FluidFFT
can be used in a real application, see `the code
<https://foss.heptapod.net/fluiddyn/fluidsim>`_ of the `Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) framework FluidSim <http://fluidsim.readthedocs.org>`_.
