# Tutorial FFT 3D sequential

In this tutorial, we present how to use fluidfft to perform 3D fft in sequential.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
from fluidfft.fft3d import methods_seq
from fluidfft import import_fft_class
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(methods_seq)
```

We import a class and instantiate it:

```{code-cell} ipython3
cls = import_fft_class('fft3d.with_pyfftw')
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
o = cls(4, 8, 12)
```

Let's have a look at the attribute of this objects.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print('\n'.join([name for name in dir(o) if not name.startswith('__')]))
```

Let's run a test and benchmark the fft and ifft functions directly from C++.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(o.run_tests())
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
t1, t2 = o.run_benchs()
print('t_fft = {} s; t_ifft = {} s'.format(t1, t2))
```

Let's understand how the data is stored:

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(o.get_dimX_K())
```

which means that for this class, in Fourier space, the data is not transposed...

Now we can get the non dimensional wavenumber in the first and second dimensions:

```{code-cell} ipython3
k0, k1, k2 = o.get_k_adim_loc()
print('k0:', k0)
print('k1:', k1)
print('k2:', k2)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(o.get_seq_indices_first_K())
```

and check that the shapes of the array in one process are the same than in sequential (we are in sequential, there is only one process):

```{code-cell} ipython3
assert o.get_shapeX_loc() == o.get_shapeX_seq()
assert o.get_shapeK_loc() == o.get_shapeK_seq()
```

Now, let's compute fast Fourier transforms. We first initialize arrays:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = np.ones(o.get_shapeX_loc())
a_fft = np.empty(o.get_shapeK_loc(), dtype=np.complex128)
```

If we do not have the array where to put the result we can do:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a_fft = o.fft(a)
```

If we already have the array where to put the result we can do:

```{code-cell} ipython3
o.fft_as_arg(a, a_fft)
```

And finally for the inverse Fourier transform:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = o.ifft(a_fft)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
o.ifft_as_arg(a_fft, a)
```

Let's mention the existence of the method ``ifft_as_arg_destroy``, which can be slightly faster than `ifft_as_arg` because it avoids one copy.

```{code-cell} ipython3
o.ifft_as_arg_destroy(a_fft, a)
```
