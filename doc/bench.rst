Benchmarking
============

Command-line utilities
----------------------

One of the advantage of using fluidfft is to be able to use the fastest fft
library for a particular problem and in a particular (super)computer.

We provide command-line utilities to easily run and analyze benchmarks. You can
for example run the commands::

  fluidfft-bench -h

  # 2d
  fluidfft-bench 1024 768
  fluidfft-bench 1024 -d 2
  mpirun -np 2 fluidfft-bench 1024 -d 2

  # 3d
  fluidfft-bench 32 48 64
  fluidfft-bench 128 -d 3
  mpirun -np 2 fluidfft-bench 128 -d 3

Once you have run many benchmarks (to get statistics) for different numbers of
processes (if you want to use MPI), you can analyze the results for example
with::

  fluidfft-bench-analysis 1024 -d 2

Benchmarks on Occigen
---------------------

`Occigen is a GENCI-CINES HCP cluster <https://www.top500.org/system/178465>`_.

   Speedup computed from the median of the elapsed times for 3d fft
   (384x1152x1152, left: fft and right: ifft) on Occigen.

For every FFT classes available for the resolution and for the two tasks fft and
ifft, three functions are used and compared (see the legends):

- "fft_cpp" (continuous lines): benchmark of the C++ function from the C++
  code. No memory allocation.

- "fft_as_arg" (dashed lines): benchmark of a Python method ``fft_as_arg`` from
  Python.  As for the C++ code, the second argument of this method is an array to
  contain the result of the transform, so no memory allocation is needed.

- "fft_return" (dotted lines): benchmark of a Python method ``fft`` from
  Python. No array is provided to the function to contain the result so a numpy
  array is created and then returned by the function.

The fastest methods are fftw1d (which is limited to 192 cores) and p3dfft.

The benchmark is not sufficiently accurate to measure the cost of calling the
functions from Python (difference between continuous and dashed lines,
i.e. between pure C++ and the "as_arg" Python method) and even the creation
of the numpy array (difference between the dashed and the dotted line,
i.e. between the "as_arg" and the "return" Python methods).

   Speedup computed from the median of the elapsed times for 3d fft
   (1152x1152x1152) on Occigen.

For this resolution, the fftw1d is also the fastest method when using only few
cores and it can not be used for more that 576 cores. The faster library when
using more cores is also p3dfft.

Benchmarks on Beskow
--------------------

`Beskow is a Cray machine running Intel processors
<https://www.pdc.kth.se/hpc-services/computing-systems>`_.

   Speedup computed from the median of the elapsed times for 3d fft
   (384x1152x1152) on Beskow.

   Speedup computed from the median of the elapsed times for 3d fft
   (1152x1152x1152) on Beskow.


Benchmarks on a `LEGI <http://www.legi.grenoble-inp.fr>`_ cluster
-----------------------------------------------------------------

We run some benchmarks on Cluster8 (2015, 12 nodes Xeon DELL C6320, 20 cores
per node).

   Speedup computed from the median of the elapsed times for 3d fft
   (320x640x640) at LEGI on cluster8.

   Speedup computed from the median of the elapsed times for 2d fft
   (2160x2160) at LEGI on cluster8.


We see that the scaling is not far from linear for intra-node computations. In
contrast, the speedup is really bad for inter-node computations.
