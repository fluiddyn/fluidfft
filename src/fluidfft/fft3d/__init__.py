"""3d Fast Fourier Transform classes (:mod:`fluidfft.fft3d`)
============================================================

This package contains extension modules containing classes for performing Fast
Fourier Transform with different methods and libraries.

To use the FFT classes in real codes, it is simpler and recommended to use the
class :class:`fluidfft.fft3d.operators.OperatorsPseudoSpectral3D` defined in
the package

.. autosummary::
   :toctree:

   operators

All FFT classes are very similar and provide the same public functions. Since
these classes are defined in Cython extensions that can not easily be compiled
on the readthedocs server, the API of the 3d classes is presented in this fake
FFT class:

.. autoclass:: FFT3dFakeForDoc
