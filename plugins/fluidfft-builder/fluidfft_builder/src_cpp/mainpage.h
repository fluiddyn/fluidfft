This file contains all documentation, no code, in the form of comment text.  It
provides chapter 1 of the documentation that is produced with doxygen. Chapter
1 includes the title page, installation instructions, and prose on the nature
of FFT and their use in our library.

@mainpage FluidFFT

The FluidFFT package provides C++ classes and their Python wrapper classes
useful to perform discrete Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) with different
libraries, in particular

@li fftw3 and fftw3-mpi
@li pfft
@li p3dfft
@li cufft (fft library by CUDA running on GPU)

These doxygen pages contain only the documentation of the C++ code.

The main documentation of the package is here: http://fluidfft.readthedocs.io.
